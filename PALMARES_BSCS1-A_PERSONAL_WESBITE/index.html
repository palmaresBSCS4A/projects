                <h2>Mary Angel Palmares</h2>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is my first time creating my own personal website and all the following contents are all information about myself. Let's start from the basic. I am currently a freshmen student of Iloilo Science and Technology University taking the course of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I chose computer science because I want a career under Data Science and now that I am taking my first steps learning the basics of my course made me realize that I chose the right course for me. Honestly, the course I'm taking now is not my dream course but because of financial shortcomings I gave up my dream course which is Law.

                <h3>ONLINE SELLING DURING PANDEMIC</h3>
            <p>Online selling has been a big help to me. During pandemic, instead of doing nothing I was inpired to earn money from a small capital to making a lot of profit from it. I was able to provide for my cats and my basic needs.</p>

                <h2>PRIMARY EDUCATION</h2>
                <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivisan Elementary School (2010-2016)</b><br><br>I finished my grade-school education  in Ivisan Elementary School from 2010-2016 located at Ivisan, Capiz which is close to my home in Ivisan. I graduated with special awards. It was a great privileged for me to finish my elementary education. I gained a lot of memories, knowledge, and experiences which I can use and treasure for the rest of my life.</p>
                <h3>JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL</h3>
                <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivisan National High School (2016-2020)</b><br><br>It seems like yesterday that I entered the gate of Ivisan National High School to start my journey as a high school learner. Indeed, time passes quickly. This where I finished secondary-junior high school education from 2016-2020. IvisanNHS is also located in Ivisan, Capiz which is the same location to my home. This is where I learned a lot, through accepting achievements and failure at the same time. I remembered having a 75 mark on one of my subjects (^_^). &nbsp; It was a roller coaster ride as I go up and downs during my JHS years it was a lot of struggle but I choose to learn freely and enjoy my years. </p>
                <h4>SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL</h4>
                <p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivisan National High School (2020-2022)</b><br><br>In the past two years, learning amidst pandemic was challenging. I saw a lot students strugle to learn without proper tools or gadgets. New-normal education was new to every learner. In the last two years of my secondary education I chose to learn in a modular mode as I did not have a stable internet connection. Modular learning was hard because you will study by yourself but because of this learning mode I was able to develop my discipline when it comes to learning.   </p>

        <h1>College Education</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a freshmen student of Iloilo Science and Technology University from Computer Department taking the course of computer science. I chose to study here because ISAT-U is focused on Science and Technology related courses. I am now living with my relatives here in Iloilo City. I took my entrance exam last April 20, 2022 and was qualified for enrollment last July 5, 2022. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a college student living with relatives is difficult and challenging. I am privileged to study at ISAT-U for free education and I will take this opportunity with positive thoughts.  </p>   </div>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an introverted person and rarely go out so most of my time is spent at home. I do like printing photocards, watching asian dramas, playing with cats, playing music on ukulele, cooking, and learning new things most of the time.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my course computer science I am very interested about Data Science and would like to pursue a career under it. Now, my interests about the different fields around my course keeps growing and would like to explore more about what computer science really is.
